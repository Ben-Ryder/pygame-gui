# pygame-gui
A library of GUI objects for pygame.  

The library contains:  
* text  
* image  
* button  
* checkbox  
* entry _(allows keyboard input)_
* cursor

**Note:** All these objects rely on local imported images for graphics, and must be supplied with an image file.
This fitted with the project I made these for, where I wanted lots of different styles. So if you want a low effort/easy use GUI library, maybe this isn't the best. 

 
_*These were made while learning to code, so I no way think they are perfect, or the best implementation._
